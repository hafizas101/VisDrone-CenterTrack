# visdrone-centertrack
This repository holds the code and results for my project titled "Multi-object tracking on drone images". In this project, I have trained CenterTrack network on VisDrone dataset in several experiment settings. Trained models have been evaluated on VisDrone test dev dataset and using [VisDrone MOT Toolkit](https://github.com/VisDrone/VisDrone2018-MOT-toolkit.git). Final results have been plotted and compared with state of the art benchmark results. The video demo of this project is on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1-l-brHvgU&ab_channel=ArslanSiddique) . The below figure shows the qualitative results of our trained model on a test-dev image.
